This game is heavily inspired by POLE POSITION (Namco/Atari) as well as by other
classic racing games. Inspiration and technical help also came from reading Lou's
Pseudo 3d Page (http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/) by Louis Gorenfeld.

Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the title screen select a race car: Green is slowest and easiest to control,
black is fastest and very difficult. The red car is the default Grand Prix car.

In game keys:

Up arrow   = faster
Down arrow = brake
Left arrow = left
Righ arrow = right

Alternative keys:

A          = faster
Z (or Y)   = brake
,          = left
.          = right

The goal is to complete as many laps as possible before time runs out. You will
get the gold cup, which counts as completing the game, if you complete 8 or more
laps. A score is also kept. You score points as follows:

- every 100 meters:                     1 point
- overtaking a car:                     5 points
- bonus per remaining second each lap: 10 points
